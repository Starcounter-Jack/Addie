// Arrays are allocated on the heap with the VALUEs directly attached after the count variable.
// They are the cheapest form of lists until you detect that new lists are derived from the list.
// Because of this, the reader will always create lists of this type if the size of the list
// is at most 16 elements. If the list is larger than that, a Vector will be created instead.
// Cons pairs are almost never used unless the program explicitly does Cons operations.
class Array : public List {
public:
    uint32_t count; // The count of VALUE objects following this integer.
    // VALUE Values[n];
